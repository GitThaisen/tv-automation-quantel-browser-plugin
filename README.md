# quantel-browser-plugin

MOS compatible Quantel video clip browser for Sofie

Requires a newer web browser that supports ES modules.

## How to use

`npm install`

`npm start`

This will start a web server running on port 8080 serving the contents in `/client`

### Alternative usage

There is no building or transpiling required, so alternatively the files in `/client` can simply be copied and served from anywhere. The internal file structure in the folder must be kept intact however.
